Using Artificial Neural Networks to Model the Non-Linear Relationships between the Fundamental Factors and the Performance of a Portfolio.

This paper aimed to investigate the hypothesis that artificial neural networks can be used to model the non-linear relationships between the fundamental factors and the performance of a financial portfolio. A feed-forward network with back propagation was used. The data used was taken from 25 years of financial statements of the current Financial Times stock exchange top 350 companies and was pre-processed in order for it to be used for machine learning. A random search was used for hyper-parameter optimization. The model was trained quarter by quarter. The results obtained by the artificial neural networks proved, using statistical methods, the results to be significantly more accurate than other machine learning methods and hence, the hypothesis to be true.

My Computer Science MSc thesis - Learnt about Machine learning/Deep learning, Python and tensorflow and implemented this in two months.

Far too much data to upload to GitHub.
